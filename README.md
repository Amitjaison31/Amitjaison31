# Hello, I'm Amit Jaison 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions. Allow me to introduce myself:

## About Me
- 🌍 I'm based in Trivandrum.
- 💼 Currently, I am interning at **Sniqsys Technosphere** as a Core Java Developer Intern.
- 🎓 I hold a B-Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from College of Engineering Attingal.
- 🌟 I'm passionate about developing android applications.
- 📚 I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies and ideas.

## Ongoing Project: Assistive Android App for the Visually Challenged 📱

I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact, and one of my ongoing projects is an Android application designed to assist the visually challenged.
The aim of this project is to help individuals with visual impairments identify obstacles in their path using their smartphone's camera and receive audio feedback about these obstacles in real-time.

### Project Details
- **Current Status**: Currently, I'm focused on implementing the audio feedback feature. My goal is to provide clear and informative audio descriptions of the obstacles that are detected by the app.
- **Description**: This app utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze the live feed from the smartphone camera and provide audio descriptions of obstacles detected.
- **Challenges Faced**: The primary challenge right now is integrating the Google Text-to-Speech API effectively into the Android Studio project to ensure clear and informative audio feedback.

### Future Plans
- In addition to obstacle detection, I have ambitious plans to incorporate facial recognition into the app.
  This feature will benefit not only visually impaired individuals but also those with short-term memory loss.
  Users will be able to identify people they meet and store their data for future reference.
- I'm excited about this development, and I'll be working on leveraging facial recognition technology to enhance the app's capabilities further.
- Collaboration and feedback are welcome! If you have expertise in facial recognition, Android app development (using Android Studio), or integration related things, I'd love to hear from you.

Stay tuned for updates on this project as I continue to work towards creating a more accessible and inclusive world through technology.

## Photography and Cinematics Enthusiast 📷🎥

When I'm not coding, I'm often out exploring the world through the lens. 
Photography has been a long-standing passion of mine, and I enjoy capturing moments that tell stories and evoke emotions.
I believe that every photograph is a return ticket to the moment otherwise gone, and I try to make every click count.

But it doesn't stop at just photos. I take those captured memories and turn them into cinematic experiences. 
Whether it's through video editing or creating visually stunning slideshows, I enjoy transforming moments into unforgettable stories.
